        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The perfect way to use up leftover veg - you can use scooped-out baked potato, mash or crushed roast or fried potatoes for this super-simple bubble and squeak. Top with fried eggs and a dash of chilli sauce for a seriously satisfying brunch or supper.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp oil, plus extra for frying</li>
            <li>25g butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>225-250g leftover vegetables, such as kale, spinach, chard, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, leeks</li>
            <li>300g leftover cooked potatoes</li>
            <li>small handful chopped fresh herbs, such as thyme, rosemary or parsley (optional)</li>
            <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the teaspoon of oil and the butter in a non-stick pan. Fry the onion until slightly softened, then add the vegetables and potatoes. Season well with salt and pepper and add the herbs, if using.</li>
            <li>Break the potatoes and vegetables up and fry undisturbed for 2-3 minutes to allow a golden brown crust to form on the bottom of the veg, then turn them over and leave to brown on the other side - keep doing this for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a potato masher to press the mixture into the pan to create a big potato cake, then slide out or upturn the pan onto a serving plate. Cover and keep warm, while you fry the eggs.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, heat a little more oil. Break in the eggs and fry to your liking. Slice the bubble and squeak into wedges and top with the fried eggs to serve.</li>
        </ol>
